<h1 class="styleguide">CWDS Pattern Library</h1>

<p class="lead">Version 0.31</p>

<p class="lead">This pattern library is for all the digital services to contribue to and use for CWDS. Current library is CSS only but our goal is to have a component-based library. This is a cross team collaborative effort between designer and developers on Intake, CALS, and Case Managment.
It is open source and the repository can be found at: <a href="">https://github.com/ca-cwds/research-design</a>
